Facts are useful, but in times like these they can also be overwhelming.  It can be helpful to organize these facts so they can provide perspective and focus our attention to the right places.  The plots on the right contain the same data that you've seen in other places but organizes them in two important ways:
1. By default, the time series for each country/state begins on the day where each location had at least one death per million people in that location.  This is meant to calibrate each country/state so they can be compared at the same initial severity.  We choose deaths (vs cases) as our measure of severity because they are less sensitive to testing capacity as we assume that patients in more critical conditions are tested more uniformly than the population at large."),
2. Days to double, the metric in the second column seeks to give us an intuitive measure of how quickly the measures in the first column are growing over time.  It is computed as the number of days it took to double the counts in the first column.  Pandemics are scary because of exponential growth, and days to double is relatively intuitive way of understanding that.
