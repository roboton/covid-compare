This set of graphs compares locations beginning when the country had the same deaths count. The idea is to be able to compare the progression of the disease from the same starting place.  We default to 10 deaths because a) deaths are a more reliable measure of severity, b) there may be noise in collecting the first few deaths, and c) we ultimately care about mortality above all else.  Counts are pretty self-explanatory but we also measure the number of days to double for each of the measures.  This second measure gives us an idea of how slowly a disease is spreading.  The higher the number of days between doubling, the slower the disease spreads - so higher is better.  Total counts, on the other hand, we'd like to keep lower.

Yet another Covid-19 dashboard, but why? I've been seeing all kinds of numbers being thrown around and varying interpretations of those numbers to try to a) better understand what's happening, and b) suggest a course of action for what to do.  My sense is that b) happens way too quickly before we get a better handle, or perspective on a).  These set of graphs are meant to focus on deaths (although cases and recoveries are also shown).  Cases and recoveries can be highly biased by Covid test allocation that may or may not relate to the severity of the outbreak or the disease.  We are making the assumption that cases are a more reliable measure and still subject to undercounting but ideally less so than cases and recoveries. In addition, deaths are what we ultimately care about and are concerned with.  If this disease spreads dramatically and doesn't cause a significant number of deaths (South Korea), the concern over cases may be misplaced.  The measure of deaths is inclusive of a location's broad capacity to control spread, allocate medical care, and manage the outbreak of Covid-19.
